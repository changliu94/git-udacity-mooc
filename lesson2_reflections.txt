What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creats a snapshot of the current status of all the files in the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?
Stating area only contains the files that are being tracked. This allows us to 
only track the files that we want.
